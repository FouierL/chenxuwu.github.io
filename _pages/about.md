<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello, I am Chenxu Wu (chinese name: 伍晨旭), a student at the University of Science and Technology of China (**USTC**), currently in my first year at the **MIRACLE Lab** under the guidance of [Prof. S. Kevin Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8eNm2GMAAAAJ&hl) and [Dr. Zihang Jiang](https://zihangjiang.github.io/). I have previously interned at **Siemens** and **Huawei**, gaining valuable industry experience.

My research interests lie in the **application technologies of diffusion models**, including image generation and diffusion posterior sampling. I am passionate about exploring the potential of these methods in various domains.

If you are interested in my work or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out to me via email at **wuchenxu [at] mail [dot] ustc [dot] edu [dot] cn**. Looking forward to connecting with you!
